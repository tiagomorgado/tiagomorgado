# Hello üëã, and welcome to my GitHub profile!

Hi! I'm **Tiago Morgado**, a **full-stack web developer** from Lisbon, Portugal.  I consider myself a *curious* and *self-directed* individual.  
These qualities make an excellent match for web development, which requires mastering the basics while staying on top of constantly changing trends.

I currently work in a **B2C Commerce Cloud Development**.  I love my job because:

- üí° I get to work closely with a group of highly talented developers, and thus, I'm constantly learning from them.
- ü§ù My contributions are valued by the rest of the team and the team lead, giving me a sense of self-worth.
- üßê I get to work every day on complex tasks, helping hone my problem-solving skills.
